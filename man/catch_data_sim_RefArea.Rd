\title{Simulated catch data from Reference Areas for vignette examples}
\format{A dataframe with 800 rows and 8 columns
\describe{
\item{ID}{identifies a unique fishing event - i.e. both longline set and haul information}
\item{Season}{The simulated CCAMLR fishing season (i.e. December from the previous calendar year through to the end of November from the current calendar year) that the longline was set and hauled}
\item{CRUISE_ID}{An ID used by Observers that is recorded with tagged fish releases}
\item{SET_ID}{An ID used by Observers that is recorded for each set-haul}
\item{SPECIES_CODE}{The three letter code used by CCAMLR to record a species. In the simulated data example this represent either Antarctic toothfish = "TOA" or Patagonian toothfish = "TOP"}
\item{CAUGHT_KG_TOTAL}{A simulated normally distributed catch that represents retained catch per longline haul}
\item{LINE_LENGTH}{A simulated normally distributed longline length}
\item{REF_AREA_CODE}{A simulated Reference Area that the data fall within that represents the current Reference Areas for Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish species}
