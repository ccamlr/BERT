### Overview

The **BERT** R package contains methods for estimating biomass with
bootstrapped confidence intervals in CCAMLR fisheries.

This document is intended to provide a log of tasks to be undertaken for this
project

### Required Features

This section lists the features we need to implement. Please update the NEWS
file when adding new functionality

* We need to write a vignette for each of the tag based and CPUE estimation 
methods. Lucy's markdown file from FSA-16 would be a good starting point.

* integrate simulated data 


### Current Issues

This section lists current problems and bugs that need to be addresses. Please 
update the NEWS file correcting issues


### Installation

Install via devtools:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("ccamlr/BERT", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```
